The objective is to use data visualization tools available in the python library **matplotlib**. The data used is the state-wise Police Complaint Registration Statistics of 2009 of all Indian States and U.Ts. It is available at <a href="#">https://www.data.gov.in</a> and was published by <https://www.ncrb.gov.in>  both part of Ministry of Home Affairs of Indian Government. The data gives the statistics of the method of complaint registration (oral/written/helpline/suomoto by police) and the category in which complaint is registered (IPC or SLL).I used **scatter plot**, **box plot** and **bar chart** to analyse the data and draw inference. The links to the **Result** and **Github repository** are given above.
