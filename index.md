 <p align="justify">
 I did my Bachelor's in Technology from <b>Delhi Technological University</b> in 2016. After that I worked as Senior Engineer in Bajaj Automobile Ltd. for close to two years. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D  under <b> Dr. Phaneendra K. Yalavarthy</b> in field of Medical Images from <b>Department of Computational and Data Sciences</b> from <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bangalore</b>. Link to my resume is <a href= "pdf/Resume.pdf" target="blank"><b>HERE</b></a>.  <br>

## Projects

### Image Denoising using CNN
#### E9 253:Neural Networks & Learning System Course Project  [[Github Page](https://github.com/ocimakamboj/DnCNN){:target="_blank"}] [[Results](Projects/NNLS/README.md)]
##### This project is done along with Ms. Ocima Kamboj [[Website](https://ocimakamboj.github.io/){:target="_blank"}]
<p align="justify">
This project was part of course <b>E9 253: Neural Networks and Learning Systems<\b> the goal was to implement Deep Learning Denoiser using residual learning. We attempted to replicate the results of Zhang et.al. in their paper <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7839189" target="blank"> Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising</a> and experimented with L2, L1 and SSIM loss functions and their combinations. We trained the network for gaussian denoising, deblurring, JPEG deblocking and image super resolution

### SpiNet
#### Schatten p-norm Regularized Medical Image Reconstruction  [[Github Page](https://github.com/adityarastogi2k12/SpiNet){:target="_blank"}]
##### Description
<p align="justify">
The objective is to use data visualization tools available in the python library <b>matplotlib</b>. The data used is the state-wise Police Complaint Registration Statistics of 2009 of all Indian States and U.Ts. It is available at <a href="https://www.data.gov.in" target="blank">https://www.data.gov.in</a> and was published by <a href="http://www.ncrb.gov.in" target="blank">http://www.ncrb.gov.in</a>, both part of Ministry of Home Affairs of Indian Government. The data gives the statistics of the method of complaint registration (oral/written/helpline/suomoto by police) and the category in which complaint is registered (IPC or SLL).I used <b>scatter plot</b>, <b>box plot</b> and <b>bar chart</b> to analyse the data and draw inference. The links to the <b>Result</b> and <b>Github repository</b> are given above.
